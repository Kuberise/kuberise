# applications:
#   - name: grafana
#     namespace: monitoring
#   - name: pgadmin
#     namespace: pgadmin
# # becuase one of the applications is deployed in keycloak namespace, external-secrets ServiceAccount is generated twice
# # in ArgoCD, which generates a warning. but it's not a problem and you can ignore it.
